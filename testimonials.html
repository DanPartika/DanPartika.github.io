              <p>
                "First and foremost, Virginia is a rare gem in this rough world! Immediately upon meeting her, I felt an overall sense of calm and comfort. She is so sweet and charming! She spoke to me first and made sure we took the time to thoroughly go through my wants and needs. She was very informative before the massage. Virginia not only gave me one of the best massages I have ever received, but also an amazing cupping session. I felt such ease and it was definitely the most relaxing massage I’ve ever had! I can’t wait to go back! She really helped me heal! Thank you!"

              "It was a pleasure meeting Virginia, who is now my new massage therapist. She is very lovely, with a lot of knowledge about anxiety and staying calm. Her massage was very professionally done and left me with a calmness that made me forget all my worries. Her oils were so soothing. I can tell she truly loves what she does and has a real talent for it. She’s not just a massage therapist, she’s a healer."

            <p>
              "Virginia is everything good in this world, meeting her was truly fate. The first time I got a massage from her, was an experience that I will never forget. Every time I leave her table I’ve never felt more relaxed and safe. She is truly a professional in her field and does her job with a true passion. Being around her energy alone is calming, and reassuring that everything will be ok. You will not regret meeting her, it’s a gift!"
